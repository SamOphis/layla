# Contributing

Please ensure that any changes you make:
* Follow the code style of the project.
* Include documentation wherever necessary.
* Are tested roughly following the procedure outlined in the README file.
* Won't get me in any trouble. I don't want cease and desist letters emailed to me. :P

I greatly appreciate contributions, so thank you a bunch. I am fairly busy these days but will
get around to reviewing pull requests whenever I can.
