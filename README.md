# Layla

Layla is a personal [Discord](https://discord.com) bot for myself and frens, mainly to accomplish common tasks we're too
lazy to do manually while also serving as a way for me to maintain my [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) knowledge.

# Self-hosting a development version

### Prerequisites:
* Have a Discord bot application with the message content intent.
* Have Git installed.
* Have a way to permanently host the bot. A cheap VPS from a reputable cloud provider will do.
* Ensure an environment variable - `LAYLA_TOKEN` - is set before running.

### Procedure:
* Clone this repository.
* `gradlew run`
* Profit.

> Further steps will be necessary in the future. I'll update this section along with them.
